# Project: kivy-statecharts - A Statechart Framework for Kivy
#
# Python Port: by Jeff Pittman, ported from SproutCore, SC.Statechart:
#
#   https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/tree/master/frameworks/statechart
#
# License:   Licensed under MIT license -- See notes below, about transferring
#            into Kivy from github.com/geojeff, done February 11, 2013, and
#            other changes.
# =============================================================================
#
# Note: The similarity between the original name of Michael Cohen's Ki
#       Statechart framework, which was later ported to SproutCore, and the
#       name Kivy, is purely coincidental.
#
# Note: The original license of Ki and of SC.Statechart is MIT, so this was
#       kept for kivy-statecharts while it was being ported and developed on
#       github.com/geojeff. It is something of an add-on to Kivy core, so
#       perhaps this is fine, but this can be reviewed for making changes
#       appropriate for living under the Kivy umbrella. The copyright lines
#       for Jeffrey Gill Pittman (geojeff) was removed on transfer to Kivy.
#
# Note: The Kivy Team changed the license of all code to MIT in July 2013, so
#       the license became:
