StatechartDiagrammer
====================

StatechartDiagrammer is a Kivy app to draw statecharts, starting with the use
of predefined shape images, but hopefully including vector shapes later.

Early Inspirations and Help
---------------------------

- Christopher Bertonha (ghostbr) asked questions in irc about a little app he
  was working on, `SkydiveNavegation`_, that illustrates how to make a button
  with a Scatter. quanon helped him get this working. 

- For the graphics part, although the initial approach here is to use an image
  in a Scatter, it was helpful to look at the code and organization in the
  ``skeleton`` package by E. Roberts, D. Gries, L. Lee, S. Marschner, and W.
  White for their computer science course at Cornell University (`CS 1110`_). 

- tito and quanon helped with a primer on textures, labels, and kv lang rules.
